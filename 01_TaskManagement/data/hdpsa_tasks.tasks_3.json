Document the actual modelling techniques that are used. Describe the assumptions. Some techniques are based on specific assumptions such as the quality, format, and distribution of data. Make sure that these assumptions hold and go back to the Data Preparation Phase if necessary.",

Specify how the dataset should be separated into training data, test data, and validation sets. The model is built on the training set and its quality estimated on the test set.",
