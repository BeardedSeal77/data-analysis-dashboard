Milestone	Phase	Suggestions	Tools	Deliverables
1	Business Understanding	Define the main goals: e.g., identify health risk zones, analyze healthcare access, and link hygiene to disease. Define key questions like: "What predicts child mortality?" or "Is HIV behavior linked to literacy?"	R Markdown / Word	Problem definition document List of project questions and KPIs Stakeholder objectives summary
1	Data Understanding	Explore all 12 datasets in R. Check dimensions, structures, distributions, missing values, outliers. Create data dictionaries.	R	R Markdown script for EDA Summary tables of key variables Visuals (bar charts, histograms, boxplots) Data dictionary (Excel/PDF)
2	Data Preparation	Clean and merge datasets where relevant (e.g., literacy + mortality, water + ARI). Handle missing values, create new variables (e.g., "Risk_Level"), normalize data if needed.	R	Cleaned and merged datasets in R Codebook of transformations RDS or CSV files of final datasets
3	Modeling (Clustering)	Use K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group provinces or communities by health risks (e.g., toilet + water + mortality). Determine optimal clusters (elbow method).	R	Clustering script (with visuals) Cluster assignment table Interpretation of clusters
3	Modeling (Classification & Association Rules)	Use Decision Trees / Random Forests to predict child mortality. Apply Apriori to find rules (e.g., "If low literacy and no toilet â†’ High ARI").	R	Classification model performance report Confusion matrix / accuracy Association rules (lift/support/confidence)
4	Evaluation	Interpret results in context. Discuss accuracy, patterns, insights. Reflect on the significance and limitations. Compare regions or population segments.	R & Word	Evaluation report Insights summary Recommendations based on findings
5	Deployment (Dashboard & Reporting)	Create Power BI dashboards and Shiny App showing key trends: access to care, mortality clusters, regional risks, hygiene coverage. Add slicers for province, age group, gender.	Power BI, Shiny App	Interactive Power BI dashboard and Shiny Apps
6	Final Report	Final Project Report and Presentation	 	Final project report (PDF) Group presentation (PPT)
