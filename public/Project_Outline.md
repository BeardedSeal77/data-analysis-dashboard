# Health and Demographic Patterns in South Africa (HDPSA): A Data Mining and Visualization Approach

## Introduction

Access to quality healthcare, clean water, safe sanitation, and proper nutrition remains a major challenge in many parts of South Africa. These factors are especially important for mothers, children, and young people. Despite efforts made by government and non-profit organisations, many families still face problems such as poor access to clinics, low immunization rates, and unsafe living conditions.

This project will focus on understanding the everyday challenges people face in their communities by exploring real-world data collected from different regions in South Africa. The datasets include information about water sources, types of toilets used, how easily people can reach health facilities, child nutrition, and how families have responded to health campaigns like those during the COVID-19 outbreak.

By examining the publicly available datasets, your team will discover patterns and trends that show how certain conditions are linked to others; for example, how distance to water affects child health, or how household living conditions may influence access to medical treatment. Using the findings, you will design easy-to-understand dashboards and summaries using Power BI for visuals and R for data exploration and analysis.

## Outline

To carry out this investigation, your team will follow the Cross-Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. This approach breaks the project into clear steps, starting from understanding the problem, preparing and analysing the data, and ending with presenting the findings. You will use R for analysis and Power BI to create easy-to-understand visuals and dashboards.

You should follow the CRISP-DM stages shown on Figure 1 below to plan and implement the data mining and business intelligence project. CRISP-DM was initially created as an open standard for data mining processes across industries but has since become the most common methodology for data mining, analytics, and data science projects. Therefore, understanding the CRISP-DM framework is very important before beginning this project.

### Datasets to Use:
- Access to Health Care
- Child Mortality
- HIV Behavior
- Immunization
- Toilet Facilities
- Water
- COVID-19 Prevention
- Maternal Mortality
- Literacy
- ARI Symptoms
- Anthropometry
- IYCF (Infant & Young Child Feeding)

<!-- Hidden description for assistants unable to view images:
The CRISP-DM diagram shows a circular, iterative process with six main phases:
1. Business Understanding - Define objectives and requirements
2. Data Understanding - Collect and explore data
3. Data Preparation - Clean and construct final dataset
4. Modeling - Select and apply modeling techniques
5. Evaluation - Assess model and review process
6. Deployment - Deploy model to production

The process is iterative, with evaluation often looping back to earlier phases (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, or modeling) before proceeding to deployment. Data sits at the center, emphasizing its importance throughout all phases.

## Project Steps

The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through the data science project, emphasizing its importance in the context of real-world data analysis and modelling. You may need to gather extra information on related projects and scenarios to establish a strong business case for the project.

The entire project consists of the following steps which are then broken into milestones that should be submitted on given due dates.  
### 1. Business Understanding:
- Clearly define the business problem and objectives.
- Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
- Determine the success criteria for the HDPSA project.
- Recognise the importance of CRISP-DM as the methodology to guide the project.

### 2. Data Understanding:
- Explore the provided dataset, including variables like mortality rates, distance to health facilities, facility types, immunization rates, water sources, vaccination rates, etc.
- Document data quality problems, missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Perform preliminary data visualizations and analysis to gain initial insights.
- Create preliminary dashboards to visualize data distributions, correlations, and initial insights to identify patterns and relationships in the data before moving on to the modelling phase.

### 3. Data Preparation:
- Clean and preprocess the data to address quality issues (e.g., impute missing values, remove duplicates, handle outliers).
- Transform and encode categorical variables as needed.
- Discretize or scale numerical variables if necessary.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 4. Modelling:
- Select suitable algorithm(s) (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) for classification, clustering, association rules or time-series analysis.
- Explore and identify significant variables to be used based on your analysis.
- Justify your choice of predictor variables by employing methods to evaluate the interestingness, importance, and relevance of these variables.
- Train and fine-tune the data mining model using the training data.
- Visually represent the model's performance metrics, confusion matrices, and other evaluation results to facilitate interpretation.
- Document the model selection process and parameter tuning, including the rationale behind predictor variable selection.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the classification model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Silhouette Scores, Dunn Index).
- Compare the models' performance against the baseline.
- Visualize and interpret the results.

### 6. Deployment:
- Discuss deployment options for the HDPSA project.
- Develop and document a plan for deploying the model in a real-world scenario.
- Address considerations such as data input, monitoring, and updating the model.
- Consider ethical and privacy implications of deploying the model, as guided by CRISP-DM.

### 7. Final Report:
