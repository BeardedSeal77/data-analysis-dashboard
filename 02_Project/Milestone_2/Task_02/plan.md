    Deliverables

    - R Markdown file: Task_02_Data_Quality_Verification.Rmd
    - 7 CSV output files for integration into final report
    - Statistical summary tables comparing across datasets
    - Field inclusion/exclusion recommendations with statistical justification

    Key Features

    - No individual dataset graphs - focus on comparative metrics
    - Averaged correlations across all datasets as requested
    - Quantitative field selection criteria based on statistical evidence
    - Data reduction analysis using PCA for dimensionality assessment
    - Exportable results for integration into final documentation

    This approach focuses specifically on statistical validation and comparative analysis to inform modeling decisions, avoiding overlap with     
     data cleaning (Task 3) or transformation (Task 4).
