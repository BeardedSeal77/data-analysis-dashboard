Correlation Analysis and Feature Importance

Conduct correlation analysis between variables. Determine feature importance and weight attributes based on their relevance to modeling requirements.



Task 4 Analysis Findings

  üìä Data Coverage Analysis

  - Total observations: 907 health indicator
  measurements
  - Unique indicators: 380 different health indicators     
  analyzed
  - Final analysis: 8 key indicators with sufficient       
  data for correlation analysis

  üîó Correlation Analysis Results

  Significant Correlations Found (|r| > 0.7):

  1. Perfect Correlations (r = 1.0):
    - Children born (weighted vs unweighted versions) -    
   expected administrative duplicates
  2. Very Strong Correlations (r = 0.97-0.99):
    - Number of men (weighted vs unweighted): r = 0.997    
    - Number of women (weighted vs unweighted): r =        
  0.975

  Key Insight:

  The significant correlations are primarily between       
  weighted and unweighted versions of the same
  demographic variables. This indicates:
  - No concerning multicollinearity between different      
  health domains
  - Technical redundancy rather than conceptual overlap    
  - Good feature independence beneficial for modeling      

  üìà Feature Importance Rankings

  Top 5 Most Important Features (by variance):

  1. Number of women (unweighted) - Variance: 3,178,574    
   (Importance: 1.0)
  2. Number of women - Variance: 1,187,128 (Importance:    
   0.37)
  3. Number of children born (unweighted) - Variance:      
  85,070 (Importance: 0.027)
  4. Number of children born - Variance: 84,372
  (Importance: 0.027)
  5. Number of men - Variance: 43,966 (Importance:
  0.014)

  Bottom Features:

  - Women with secondary education - Very low variance     
  (186)
  - Fully vaccinated children - Minimal variance (0.98)    

  ‚öñÔ∏è Weight Attribution Strategy

  Based on discriminatory power analysis:

  High Weight (3x) - Top 5 Features:

  - Number of women (unweighted/weighted)
  - Number of children born (unweighted/weighted)
  - Number of men

  Medium Weight (2x) - Remaining 3 Features:

  - Number of men (unweighted)
  - Women with secondary education
  - Fully vaccinated children

  üéØ Key Implications for Modeling

  Positive Findings:

  ‚úÖ Good Feature Independence: No problematic
  multicollinearity between health domains‚úÖ Clear         
  Importance Hierarchy: Demographic variables show
  highest discriminatory power‚úÖ Evidence-Based 
  Weights: Quantitative foundation for feature
  weighting

  Considerations:

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Health Indicators: Only 8 indicators had      
  sufficient data coverage‚ö†Ô∏è Demographic Dominance:        
  Population counts dominate importance rankings‚ö†Ô∏è
  Weighted/Unweighted Redundancy: May need to choose       
  one version of each variable

  üìã Recommendations for Task 5

  1. Multicollinearity Management: Address
  weighted/unweighted redundancy
  2. Feature Selection: Consider keeping only weighted     
  OR unweighted versions
  3. Expand Coverage: Investigate why only 8 of 380        
  indicators survived filtering
  4. Domain Balance: Ensure adequate representation        
  across health domains
  5. Weight Implementation: Apply 3x/2x/1x/0.5x
  multipliers in modeling phase
