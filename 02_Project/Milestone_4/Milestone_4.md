# Project Milestone 4
## Introduction 
This project will investigate various health and demographic datasets to identify meaningful patterns 
and trends. The details of the project requirements are described in the Project Outline document. 
The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through 
the  data  science  project,  emphasizing  its  importance  in  the  context  of  real-world  data  analysis  and 
modelling.  

## Outline
The  project  is  divided  into  six  (6)  milestones,  where  at  each  stage  some  deliverables  are  to  be 
produced in terms of a series of reports that describe the project plan, the work carried out during the 
iterative process of data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment.  
 
The  CRISP-DM  methodology  breaks  down  a  data mining  project  life  cycle  into  six  phases  with  each 
phase  consisting of many secondary tasks.  This milestone  addresses the Evaluation Phase of  CRISP-
DM. 
 
### Evaluation 
Evaluation is the fifth phase of the CRISP-DM methodology and follows the modelling phase. The 
objective of this phase is to look more broadly at how the chosen model best meets the business 
objectives and justify why this model is appropriate to use. Unlike the Assess Model task of the 
Modelling phase which focuses on technical model assessment, the Evaluation phase does not just 
focus on the models you built but also the process that you used to create them, and their potential 
for practical use.

## Tasks 
This milestone consists of the following tasks that should be submitted as an assignment on given 
due date. 

1. **Evaluate Results:**
   - Assess the results in relation to business goals
   - Approve model(s) that meet the business success criteria

2. **Review the Process:**
   - Review the entire process from Phase 1 to determine if all steps were properly executed
   - Report any issues that were missed or overlooked and need to be repeated
   - Summarize findings, including quality assurance issues and correct anything if needed
   - Consider ways that you might improve your process for future projects

3. **Determine the Next Steps:**
   - List all possible actions after this phase (with reasons for and against)
   - Decide how to proceed with the project (deploy, further iterate, or abandon and re-start another project)

## Deliverables:
- Evaluation Report (in PDF or document format)
