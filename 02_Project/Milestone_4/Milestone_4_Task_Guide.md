# Milestone 4 Task Guide

## Overview
- **Phase**: Evaluation (CRISP-DM Phase 5)
- **Focus**: Assess model performance against business objectives
- **Model**: Random Forest Regression (primary from Milestone 3)
- **Context**: South African health datasets (609 records)

---

## Task 1: Evaluate Results
**Assigned to: [Member Name]**

### Objective:
Assess the Random Forest model results in relation to business goals and determine if it meets success criteria.

### Requirements:
- **Business Goals Review**: Revisit original project objectives from Milestone 1
- **Performance Assessment**: Evaluate model metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared) against success thresholds
- **Business Success Criteria**: Determine if model accuracy is sufficient for health policy decisions
- **Model Approval**: Provide clear recommendation (approve/reject) with justification

### Key Questions to Address:
- Does the model meet the minimum accuracy requirements?
- Is the model reliable enough for healthcare decision-making?
- Are the variable importance insights actionable for policymakers?
- Does the model performance align with stakeholder expectations?

### Deliverable:
- Results assessment report
- Business success criteria evaluation
- Model approval recommendation with reasoning

## Task 2: Review the Process
**Assigned to: [Member Name]**

### Objective:
Review the entire CRISP-DM process from Phase 1 through Phase 4 to identify any gaps or issues.

### Review Scope:
- **Phase 1 (Business Understanding)**: Were objectives clearly defined?
- **Phase 2 (Data Understanding)**: Was data exploration thorough?
- **Phase 3 (Data Preparation)**: Were transformations appropriate and documented?
- **Phase 4 (Modeling)**: Was model selection and implementation sound?

### Analysis Requirements:
- Identify steps that were executed properly
- Report any issues that were missed or overlooked
- Highlight quality assurance concerns
- Document corrective actions needed (if any)

### Process Improvement:
- Lessons learned from this project
- Recommendations for future projects
- Process optimization suggestions

### Deliverable:
- Process review report covering all phases
- Issues and gaps identified
- Quality assurance summary
- Improvement recommendations

## Task 3: Determine Next Steps
**Assigned to: [Member Name]**

### Objective:
Decide on the project path forward based on evaluation results.

### Possible Actions to Consider:
1. **Deploy**: Move model to production
2. **Further Iterate**: Additional modeling cycles needed
3. **Abandon/Restart**: Project does not meet requirements

### Decision Framework:
For each possible action, document:
- **Reasons For**: Why this action makes sense
- **Reasons Against**: Potential drawbacks or concerns
- **Requirements**: What would be needed to pursue this path
- **Timeline**: Estimated effort and duration

### Final Recommendation:
- Clear decision on how to proceed
- Justification based on evaluation findings
- Implementation plan outline (if deploying)
- Next iteration plan (if continuing modeling)

### Deliverable:
- List of possible actions with pros/cons
- Final decision with detailed justification
- Action plan for chosen path

## Deliverables Summary:
- **Combined Evaluation Report** containing:
  - Task 1: Results evaluation and model approval
  - Task 2: Process review and quality assessment
  - Task 3: Next steps decision and action plan
- **Format**: PDF or document format
- **Total Points**: 40 marks

---

## Notes:
- Focus on business value, not just technical metrics
- Be honest about limitations and gaps
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Connect findings back to original business objectives
