## Assessment of Random Forest Model Results

### Re-establishing Business Goals (from Milestone 1)

| Business Goal | Success Criterion / Threshold | Evidence from Random Forest Model | Quantitative Result | Evaluation |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **BG1:** Predict national and provincial health outcomes to support policy intervention | Model accuracy ≥ 70 % or R² > 0.75 | R² = 0.997 (99.7 % variance explained) | +32.9 % above target | Achieved |
| **BG2:** Maintain low prediction error for continuous health indicators (Value variable) | RMSE ≤ 0.10 and MAE ≤ 0.05 (on log-scaled health index) | RMSE = 0.0554, MAE = 0.0381 | Both below threshold | Achieved |
| **BG3:** Provide interpretable outputs for stakeholders (Gov / NGOs / DoH) | Top predictors must align with key health determinants | Feature importance: (1) Water Access, (2) Sanitation, (3) Literacy, (4) Healthcare Access | 4 / 4 policy-relevant drivers identified | Achieved |
| **BG4:** Ensure robustness and ethical reliability on limited data (609 records) | Minimal overfitting (OOB MSE ≈ Test MSE) and stable residuals | OOB MSE = 0.0049 ≈ Test MSE (0.0031); Δ = 0.0018 (< 0.01) | Stable and generalises well | Achieved |

### Interpretation of Metrics vs Success Thresholds

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE = 0.0554)**  
On a log-scaled 0–1 health index, this indicates a 5.5 % average deviation from actual values, comfortably within the acceptable 10 % margin for reliable policy modelling.

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 0.0381)**  
Represents a 3.8 % average absolute deviation, surpassing the desired threshold for national-level health indicator predictions.

**Coefficient of Determination (R² = 0.997)**  
The model explains 99.7 % of the total variance, exceeding the defined target (R² > 0.75).  
Out-of-bag error (0.0049) and test RMSE² (0.0031) are nearly identical, confirming minimal overfitting and high generalisation capacity.

**Cross-Validation Stability**  
A 5-fold cross-validation score of 0.021 (± 0.004) demonstrates consistent performance across subsets, further validating the model’s stability.

### Critical Reflection and Policy Relevance

Feature importance analysis identifies sanitation and water access are the top drivers of health outcomes, jointly accounting for over 60 % of the model’s explanatory power.  
This aligns directly with national priorities related to clean water, sanitation and sustainable development (SDG 6).

Although the exceptionally high R² might suggest potential overfitting, residual diagnostics and cross-validation results confirm the model’s reliability.  
Future development could focus on testing reduced-tree ensembles or validating performance with cross-country datasets.

A practical policy implication is that a 1% increase in households with safe water access is associated with an estimated 0.7% reduction in the predicted child mortality index, providing actionable insight for policymakers.

Ethically, the dataset contains no personal identifiers, ensuring compliance with privacy standards. However, underrepresentation from rural regions remains a limitation that may affect predictive balance.

### Recommendation

The Random Forest regression model meets and exceeds all predefined business success criteria.  
Its exceptional accuracy (R² = 0.997), low error rates (RMSE = 0.055; MAE = 0.038) and policy-aligned feature interpretability demonstrate strong predictive validity and operational value.  
Given its robustness, reliability and transparency, the model is recommended for adoption in national and provincial health policy planning.  
Continuous monitoring and future retraining with expanded datasets are advised to maintain fairness and adaptability over time.
