# Project Milestone 6
## Introduction 
This project will investigate various health and demographic datasets to identify meaningful patterns 
and trends. The details of the project requirements are described in the Project Outline document. 
The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through 
the  data  science  project,  emphasizing  its  importance  in  the  context  of  real-world  data  analysis  and 
modelling.  

## Outline
The project is divided into six (6) milestones, where at each stage some deliverables are to be 
produced in terms of a series of reports that describe the project plan, and the work carried out during the iterative process of data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment.  
 
The  CRISP-DM  methodology  breaks  down  a  data mining  project  life  cycle  into  six  phases  with  each 
phase consisting of many secondary tasks. This milestone addresses the Deployment Phase of CRISP-
DM. 
 
### Deployment 
Deployment is the sixth and final phase of the CRISP-DM methodology and comes after the 
evaluation phase. The models created during the modelling phase are not particularly useful unless 
the results are available for use by the intended audience. The solutions generated in the modelling 
phase are only valuable if they are put into action. The objective of the deployment phase is to take 
the solutions generated in the modelling phase and put them in an environment where they can be 
used to drive business value. This phase is critical to the success of the data mining process because 
without proper deployment, the business benefits of the project are not realised despite all the 
efforts that went into the project. 

## Tasks 
This milestone consists of the following tasks that should be submitted as an assignment on given 
due date. The focus of this milestone are the last two tasks of the Deployment Phase. 

1. **Produce Final Report:**
   - Summarise the project and your experiences
   - Produce a final report (in PDF or document format) detailing all project steps, key findings, ethical implications and recommendations for improvement
   - Include all the previous deliverables and summary of the results
   - Include a section on ethical analysis, detailing the ethical challenges encountered when handling sensitive information and how these were addressed
   - The final report should not be more than 8 pages long (approximately 2000 to 3000 words 1.5 line spacing and font size 11 or 12) excluding cover page, table of contents, references, and other front matter
   - Prepare a final demo and presentation of the data mining model and results

2. **Review Project:**
   - Summarise important experiences made during the project (what went well, what could have been better, and what improvements can be made in the future)
   - Discuss your overall learning experience (what have you learned, how relevant are the knowledge and skills gained from this project, how can the projects be handled in future)
   
Ensure that all your code is well-organized according to the CRISP-DM steps, thoroughly documented, uses appropriate data science libraries and tools, runs without errors, produces correct results, and is optimized for efficiency and performance


## Deliverables:
- Final Project Report in PDF format (not more than 8 pages of content)
- Presentation (not more than 10 slides of content)
- Final project files and code (R Markdown) developed throughout the project
- Power BI Project file or Shiny app for visual storytelling and interactive dashboards
- If the code is hosted on a cloud repository or version control platform like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and SourceForge, also provide the link to the code repository as part of the report
- Project files and/or code for any other tools used during this assignment
