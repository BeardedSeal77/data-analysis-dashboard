## Business Relevance

Understanding patterns across these interconnected health domains is crucial for:
- Government policy formulation and resource allocation
- Non-profit organizations targeting health interventions
- International development agencies supporting health programs
- Healthcare providers planning service delivery
- Researchers investigating social determinants of health

The comprehensive nature of this data collection allows for multifaceted analysis revealing relationships between healthcare access, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes, providing actionable insights for improving population health in South Africa.


Business Problem and Objectives
Business Problem:
Despite numerous past interventions, vulnerable populations in South Africa still experience poor healthcare outcomes due to systematic issues like sanitation, lack of clean water and healthcare access. Stakeholders require reliable, data-driven insights to understand the relationships between living conditions, healthcare access and healthcare risks.
Business Objectives:
•	Provide actionable insights that stakeholders can use to target interventions more effectively.
•	Discover the key factors that are currently contributing to poor health outcomes, for example clean water, sanitation, literacy etc.
•	Develop interactive dashboards and reports that make complex data easy to understand.
•	Identify high-risk regions and communities based on demographic and health indicators.




Stakeholders and Their Requirements

Stakeholder	Requirements	Example KPI
Government (Department of Health)	Identify provinces with the high health risks and resource gaps.	Reduction in child mortality rates (%).
NGOs/NPOs	Prioritize regions for campaigns (HIV prevention, sanitation, immunization)	Increase in immunization coverage (%).
Healthcare Providers and Clinics	Understand the population needs and healthcare access issues.	Clinic to population ratio.
Researchers/Academics	Access to structured datasets and insights for policy studies.	Number of published findings.



Success Criteria
Analytical Success:
•	Build models (classification, clustering, association rules) that achieve acceptable performance (for example, prediction accuracy > 70%).
•	Identify meaningful clusters with similar healthcare challenges.
•	Extract meaningful rules (for example, low literacy + no sanitation = high ARI risk).
Business Success:
•	Insights led to practical recommendations for healthcare and community interventions.
•	Dashboards highlight priority areas for intervention (geographic or demographic).
•	Stakeholders confirm results are useful for guiding decision-making.
