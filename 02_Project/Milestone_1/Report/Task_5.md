# Task 5: Data Mining Goals and Success Criteria
## Data-Mining Goals
1. **Predictive Modeling of Health Risks:**  
Develop classification models to predict high-risk populations and regions based on socioeconomic and healthcare access variables, aiming for prediction accuracy above 70%.

2. **Clustering of Communities by Health Challenges:**  
Identify meaningful clusters of communities with similar healthcare access issues and health outcomes to enable targeted interventions.

3. **Association Rule Mining for Key Risk Factors:**  
Extract actionable association rules that reveal combinations of factors (e.g., low literacy and poor sanitation) strongly linked to adverse health outcomes.

4. **Geospatial Analysis for Priority Area Identification:**  
Analyze geographic patterns to pinpoint provinces and districts with the greatest healthcare resource gaps and health risks.

5. **Interactive Dashboard Development:**  
Create user-friendly dashboards that visualize complex data and model results, facilitating stakeholder understanding and decision-making.

6. **Data Structuring and Integration for Research Use:**  
Prepare and structure datasets to support researchers and policymakers in conducting further studies on social determinants of health.
## Data-Minining Sucess Criteria
1. **Model Performance Benchmarks:**  
Classification models must achieve a minimum prediction accuracy of 70% or higher on validation datasets to be considered successful.

2. **Meaningful Pattern Discovery:**  
Clustering and association rule mining should identify interpretable and actionable patterns, such as clusters of communities with similar health risks and rules linking key factors (e.g., sanitation, literacy) to health outcomes, validated by domain experts.

3. **Stakeholder Validation and Usefulness:**  
Insights and visualizations must be confirmed by stakeholders (government, NGOs, healthcare providers) as relevant and useful for guiding targeted health interventions and resource allocation.

4. **Deployment and Accessibility:**  
Interactive dashboards and reports must be successfully deployed and accessible to all key stakeholders, enabling real-time decision-making and ongoing monitoring of health indicators.
