# Task 1: Background

## Dataset Context

This project analyzes South African health datasets from the Health Data Platform South Africa (HDPSA), comprising 13 national-level datasets following DHS format covering:

- Healthcare access and mortality rates
- Child and maternal health indicators  
- Nutrition and immunization data
- Disease prevention and management
- Social determinants (literacy, water, sanitation)

## CRISP-DM Methodology

This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, a structured approach for data science projects consisting of six phases:

1. **Business Understanding** - Define objectives and requirements
2. **Data Understanding** - Collect, describe, and explore data
3. **Data Preparation** - Clean and transform data for analysis
4. **Modeling** - Apply analytical techniques
5. **Evaluation** - Assess model performance and business value
6. **Deployment** - Plan implementation and monitoring

CRISP-DM provides a proven framework for systematic data analysis, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all project aspects from business objectives through to deployment, making it ideal for this health data analysis project.
