# Topic 4: Risks, Assumptions and Constraints 

## Risks
A primary risk that we could face is having mising or even incomplete data within our dataset. This compromise the accuracy and integrity of the data analysed. This can lead to to a skewed and inaccurate understanding of South African healthcare. This issu extends not only from simple data gaps, such as rural pouplation or even age brackets. 

Relying on national level data may overshadow regional results, which would lead to a misconception, causing a generalized insight that fails to address specific situations faced by each province and/or community. 

Finally, time limitation for modeling and cleaning data, which could force teams assigned to the project to take shortcuts and cut corners. This leads to sub-par models selections and fill the dataset with insignifacant to major errors, reducing the reliability of the recorded datasets. 

## Assumptions 
There are two fundamental assumtions made when it comes to this project. Firstly, all the dataset provided will be accurate and are a true represetation of the populution. This wold suggest that the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) is accurate and a proper represetation of the nation's varied demographic and health environment. Assuming that the sampling (collections, cleaning, storing, etc) will be bias free. 

Secondly, we assume that stakeholders will actually use the data collected as insight to enhance healthcare policies. This is a critical component of the project's impact since it assumes organizational buy-in and a commitment to convert the data-driven conclusions into concrete policy changes.

## Constraints 
Since there is no provision for primary data collection, the project's limitation to the datasets that have been provided are its biggest limitation.  As a result, any research issues that are not covered by the 13 datasets that are currently available cannot be addressed,Â because the analysis is tightly constrained by the information that is currently available.  As a result, the team is unable to confirm findings using fresh data, and the integrity of the HDPSA data is crucial to the project's overall conclusions.  The majority of the datasets are cross-sectional, which makes it difficult to examine patterns or the long-term effects of health-related factors across time. This limitation also reduces the possibility of longitudinal research.
