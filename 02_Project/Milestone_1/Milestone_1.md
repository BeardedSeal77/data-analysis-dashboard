# Project Milestone 1 
## Introduction 
This project will investigate various health and demographic datasets to identify meaningful patterns 
and trends. The details of the project requirements are described in the Project Outline document. 
The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through 
the  data  science  project,  emphasizing  its  importance  in  the  context  of  real-world  data  analysis  and 
modelling.  

## Outline
The  project  is  divided  into  six  (6)  milestones,  where  at  each  stage  some  deliverables  are  to  be 
produced in terms of a series of reports that describe the project plan, and the work carried out during 
the iterative process of data preparation, modelling, evaluation and eventual deployment.  
 
While  CRISP-DM  breaks  down  a  data  mining  project  life  cycle  into  six  phases  with  each  phase 
consisting of many secondary tasks, the focus of this milestone is on the first two phases. These phases 
help organisations understand the objectives of the project from a business perspective and identify, 
collect, and analyse the data sets that can help accomplish the project goals. You may need to gather 
more information on related projects and scenarios to establish a strong business case for the project. 
 
### Understand the Business 
Thoroughly understand, from a business (government or non-profit organisations) perspective, what the project really wants to accomplish. Uncover important factors, that can influence the outcome of  the project, record the information that is known about the business situation during this phase of the project. 
 
### Understand the Data 
Start off with the initial data collection and proceed with activities that enable you to become familiar with the data, identifying data quality problems, discovering first insights into the data, and/or detect  interesting subsets to form hypotheses regarding hidden information. 

## Tasks 
The entire project consists of the following steps which are then broken into milestones that should be submitted on given due dates.

1. **Business Understanding:**
   - Clearly define the business problem and objectives.
   - Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
   - Determine the success criteria for the recommendation system.
   - Recognize the importance of CRISP-DM as the methodology to guide the project.

2. **Data Understanding:**
   - Explore the provided datasets, including variables like mortality rates, distance to health facilities, facility types, immunisation rates, water sources, literacy, vaccination rates, etc.
   - Project Scoping and Data Exploration Report (in PDF or document format).
   - Code (R, R Markdown) used for data analysis and modelling.
   - Power BI project file if Power BI was used during this phase of the project.

## Deliverables:
- Project Scoping and Data Exploration Report (in PDF or document format).
- Code (R, R Markdown) used for data analysis and modelling.
- Power BI project file if Power BI was used during this phase of the project.
