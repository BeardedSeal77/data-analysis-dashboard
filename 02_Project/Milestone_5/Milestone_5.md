# Project Milestone 5
## Introduction 
This project will investigate various health and demographic datasets to identify meaningful patterns 
and trends. The details of the project requirements are described in the Project Outline document. 
The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through 
the  data  science  project,  emphasizing  its  importance  in  the  context  of  real-world  data  analysis  and 
modelling.  

## Outline
The  project  is  divided  into  six  (6)  milestones,  where  at  each  stage  some  deliverables  are  to  be 
produced in terms of a series of reports that describe the project plan, and the work carried out during 
the iterative process of data preparation, modelling, evaluation and eventual deployment.  
 
The  CRISP-DM  methodology  breaks  down  a  data mining  project  life  cycle  into  six  phases  with  each 
phase consisting of many secondary tasks. This milestone addresses the Deployment Phase of CRISP-
DM. 
 
### Deployment 
Deployment is the sixth and final phase of the CRISP-DM methodology and comes after the 
evaluation phase. The models created during the modelling phase are not particularly useful unless 
the results are available for use by the intended audience. The solutions generated in the modelling 
phase are only valuable if they are put into action. The objective of the deployment phase is to take 
the solutions generated in the modelling phase and put them in an environment where they can be 
used to drive business value. This phase is critical to the success of the data mining process because 
without proper deployment, the business benefits of the project are not realised despite all the 
efforts that went into the project. 

## Tasks 
This milestone consists of the following tasks that should be submitted as an assignment on given 
due date. The first two tasks (Plan Deployment, and Plan Monitoring and Maintenance) should be 
submitted as Milestone 5, and the last two tasks will constitute Milestone 6. 

1. **Plan Deployment:**
   - Evaluate the results and determine a strategy for deployment of the data mining result(s) into the business
   - Summarise the deployment strategy, including necessary steps and how to perform them:
     - Summarize deployable results
     - Develop and evaluate alternative plans for deployment
     - Determine how knowledge or information will be propagated to users
     - Decide how the use of the result will be monitored and its benefits measured (where applicable)
     - Establish how the model result will be deployed within the organisation's systems
     - Determine how its use will be monitored and its benefits measured
   - Conduct some research on data mining and machine learning deployment tools
   - Evaluate the different deployment tools and motivate your recommended deployment tool
   - Deploy the final model in a user-friendly interface using the preferred deployment tool (e.g. Shiny)

2. **Plan Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Monitoring and maintenance are important issues if the data mining results are to be incorporated into the day-to-day operations of the business
   - Address considerations such as data input, post-deployment monitoring, and updating the model
   - Summarise the monitoring and maintenance strategy including necessary steps and how to perform them:
     - Check for dynamic aspects (i.e., what things could change in the environment?)
     - Decide how accuracy will be monitored
     - Determine when the data mining result or model should not be used any more
     - Identify criteria (validity, threshold of accuracy, new data, change in the application domain, etc.), and what should happen if the model or result could no longer be used (update model, set up new data mining project, etc.)
     - Will the business objectives of the use of the model change over time? Fully document the initial problem the model was attempting to solve


3. **Produce Final Report:**
  - Summarise the project and your experiences. 
  - Produce a final report (in PDF format) detailing all project steps, key findings, ethical implications and recommendations for improvement. 
  - Include all the previous deliverables and summary of the results. 
  - Consider ethical and privacy implications of deploying the model, as guided by CRISP-DM. 
  - Prepare a final demo and presentation of the data mining model and results.

4. **Review Project:**
  - Summarise important experiences made during the project (what went well, what could have been better, and what improvements can be made in the future) 
  - Discuss your overall learning experience (what have you learned, how relevant are the knowledge and skills gained from this project, how can the projects be handled in future) 

## Deliverables:
- Deployment and Maintenance Plan (in PDF or document format)
- Model deployment demo in a user-friendly interface (e.g. Shiny)
