## Minimal Demo

- Reporting UI: `app/project/reporting/page.tsx` (embeds Power BI and explains data sources)
- Prediction UI: `app/project/predict/page.tsx`
- ML API: `02_Project/api/` for training/evaluation/prediction endpoints (see `02_Project/api/API_Documentation.md`)

Run locally:
1) Ensure both Flask APIs are running (see root `README.md` Getting Started)
2) Start Next.js with `npm run next-dev`
3) Visit `http://localhost:3000/project/reporting` and `http://localhost:3000/project/predict`

## Upstream Dependencies

- Evaluation outcomes: `02_Project/Milestone_4/Task_1.md`, `Task_2.md`, `Task_3.md`
- Model artifacts: `02_Project/Milestone_3/Task_03/outputs/`
