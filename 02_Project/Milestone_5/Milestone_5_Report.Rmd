## 1.2 Deployable Results Summary

### Model Performance (Milestone 4 Validation)

```{r model-metrics}
metrics_table <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("R² Score", "RMSE", "MAE", "Training Samples", "Features", "Test Samples"),
  Value = c("0.997", "0.0554", "0.0382", "560", "27", "38"),
  Interpretation = c(
    "Excellent variance explained (99.7%)",
    "Low error on log-scaled target",
    "Mean absolute error",
    "DHS survey records (1998-2016)",
    "Engineered features from Milestone 2",
    "Held-out validation set"
  )
)

kable(metrics_table,
      caption = "Model Performance Summary",
      align = c("l", "r", "l"))
```

### Top Predictive Features (Milestone 4)

The model's predictions are driven by six key features (by permutation importance):

1. **indicator_encoded** (0.342) - Which health indicator determines value range
2. **precision_scaled** (0.156) - Survey precision correlates with values
3. **data_quality_score_scaled** (0.128) - Higher quality surveys show distinct patterns
4. **dataset_source_encoded** (0.095) - Health domain influences scale
5. **sample_size_tier** (0.087) - Large samples correlate with value ranges
6. **type_I** (0.064) - Indicator type affects values

**Key Insight:** The model learns indicator identity and survey quality relationships. It predicts survey statistics based on metadata patterns (1998-2016 training distribution), not causal health mechanisms.

### Scope and Limitations

**In Scope:**

- Survey indicator value prediction based on metadata
- Data quality validation (predicted vs actual comparison)
- Historical gap-filling for missing records
- Interactive reporting dashboards for trend exploration

**Out of Scope:**

- Individual health outcome prediction (population-level data only)
- Causal analysis between health domains
- Time series forecasting beyond 2016
- Real-time streaming (batch processing only)

**Critical Limitation:** Model reflects pattern-matching within 1998-2016 aggregated survey statistics, not predictive power for individual outcomes or future time periods.

\newpage

# Ethical Considerations

## Scope and Limitations

### In Scope

- Survey indicator value prediction based on metadata
- Data quality validation
- Historical gap-filling
- Interactive reporting for policy communication
- Performance monitoring

### Out of Scope

- Individual health outcome prediction (population-level data only)
- Causal analysis (cannot link domains like water → health)
- Time series forecasting beyond 2016
- Real-time streaming (batch processing only)

### Critical Limitations

**Data Characteristics:**

- Aggregated statistics, not individual records
- Each indicator appears only 2-4 times (age groups × 2 years: 1998, 2016)
- Cannot identify outliers with limited data points
- Cannot establish causal relationships between health domains

**Model Behavior:**

- Learns patterns between survey metadata and reported values
- Reflects 1998-2016 historical patterns, may not generalize post-2016
- Limited to 27 specific engineered features
- Predictions are pattern-matching, not causal inference

## Fairness and Bias

### Mitigation Strategies

**Subgroup Analysis:**

- Monitor error parity across provinces
- Track performance for urban vs rural populations
- Document known biases in Model Card

**User Education:**

- Clear disclaimers on prediction pages
- Alert when input differs significantly from training distribution
- Emphasize population-level predictions only

**Transparent Limitations:**

# Conclusion

## Key Accomplishments

This Milestone 5 report documents successful deployment of the HDPSA Random Forest model as a comprehensive Survey Data Analytics Tool, completing CRISP-DM Phase 6:

**1. Strategic Planning (Task 1):**

- Stakeholder analysis identifying health ministry teams, survey planners, researchers, and policy analysts
- Tool selection justification (Next.js + Flask + Python microservices)
- Success metrics across technical, usage, and business impact dimensions

**2. Technical Implementation (Task 2):**

- 3-tier microservices architecture (Next.js UI, Flask API, Python ML Service)
- Dashboard page for model training and performance monitoring
- Predictions page for data quality validation (compares predicted vs actual values)
- Reporting section for interactive visualization of training data

**3. Maintenance Strategy (Task 3):**

- Retraining procedures with performance and drift triggers
- Semantic versioning and model registry
- Retirement policy with archival and stakeholder communication
- Quarterly governance schedule with RACI matrix

**4. Monitoring Plan (Task 4):**

- Automated performance tracking (RMSE, MAE, R² weekly)
- Drift detection (KS tests, PSI, output distribution monitoring)
- n8n workflow for scheduled monitoring, alerting, and reporting
- Ethical monitoring (fairness tests, POPIA compliance, explainability tracking)

## Model Positioning

### Legitimate Use Cases

**Data Quality Validation:**

- Compare predicted survey values to actual reported values
- Flag outliers or suspicious data points before publication
- Detect data entry errors or methodological issues

**Survey Planning:**

- Estimate expected indicator values for budgeting
- Plan sample sizes based on predicted distributions
- Set realistic targets for survey teams

**Gap-Filling:**

- Impute missing indicator values based on survey metadata
- Complete historical datasets for longitudinal analysis
- Fill in provincial breakdowns when only national data available

**Policy Communication:**

- Interactive dashboards for stakeholder presentations
- Visual exploration of water access, child mortality, antenatal care trends
- Provincial comparisons and trend analysis

### Acknowledged Limitations

**Population-Level Only:**

- Predictions are aggregated statistics, not individual outcomes
- Cannot predict specific household or individual health status
- Should not be used for individual-level decisions

**No Causal Inference:**

- Model learns correlations, not causal relationships
- Cannot answer "Does water access cause better health?"
- Cannot link domains (e.g., water → immunization outcomes)

**Historical Context Bound:**

- Training data from 1998-2016
- Patterns may not generalize to post-2016 context
- Cannot forecast future trends beyond training distribution

**Limited Data Points:**

- Each indicator appears only 2-4 times in training data
- Cannot reliably identify outliers with limited samples
- Predictions reflect pattern-matching, not robust statistical inference

## Recommendations

### Short-Term (3 Months)

**Infrastructure:**

1. Complete MongoDB logging integration for predictions and metrics
2. Implement n8n monitoring workflow with alerting
3. Security hardening: input sanitization, rate limiting, penetration testing

**User Enablement:**

4. Conduct stakeholder training sessions (30-min webinar)
5. Create video demos for predictions and reporting
6. Publish comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting guide

### Medium-Term (6-12 Months)

**Model Enhancement:**

1. Model retraining with additional data (2017-2024 surveys if available)
2. Add confidence intervals on predictions (bootstrap or quantile regression)
3. Expand reporting dashboards (child mortality, antenatal care, nutrition)

**Deployment:**

4. Docker containerization for easier deployment
5. Production hosting on Vercel + Render or Belgium Campus server
6. Authentication and role-based access control

### Long-Term (12+ Months)
